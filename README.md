## Headings

Markdown supports different levels of headings, from heading 1 to heading 6. Headings help organize content and provide structure to a document.

`# Heading 1`

# Heading 1

`## Heading 2`

## Heading 2

`### Heading 3`

### Heading 3

`#### Heading 4`

#### Heading 4

`##### Heading 5`

##### Heading 5

`###### Heading 6`

###### Heading 6

## Text Formatting

Text can be formatted using different styles:

`*Italic Text*`

- *Italic Text*: Surround text with single asterisks or underscores.

`**Bold Text**`

- **Bold Text**: Surround text with double asterisks or underscores.

`~~Strikethrough Text~~`

- ~~Strikethrough Text~~: Surround text with double tildes.

## Lists

Both unordered and ordered lists are supported in Markdown.

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, use a hyphen (-), plus (+), or an asterisk (*) followed by a space.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, begin each line with a number followed by a period and a space.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Links

Markdown allows creating links to external web pages or local files:

## Tables

Markdown supports creating tables to present tabular data. The syntax for creating tables includes pipes (|) and hyphens (-) to define columns and a header row.

```
| Name   | Age | Occupation |
|--------|-----|------------|
| John   | 25  | Engineer   |
| Alice  | 32  | Designer   |
| Emily  | 28  | Writer     |
```

| Name   | Age | Occupation |
|--------|-----|------------|
| John   | 25  | Engineer   |
| Alice  | 32  | Designer   |
| Emily  | 28  | Writer     |

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight quotes or excerpts from a source. To create a blockquote, prepend the text with the greater than (>) symbol.

`> This is a blockquote. It is used to highlight a quote or excerpt from a source.`

> This is a blockquote. It is used to highlight a quote or excerpt from a source.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks can be formatted using triple backticks (```) followed by the programming language.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

greet()
```

## Horizontal Rules

To insert a horizontal rule, use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.

---

## Inline Code

You can highlight inline code using backticks like:

```
`var x = 10;`
```

`var x = 10;`

## Task Lists

Task lists represent tasks or to-do items with checkboxes. A checkbox can be checked or unchecked depending on the status of the task.

```
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Math Equations

Markdown supports writing math equations using LaTeX syntax. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:

`$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be added to provide additional information or references. They are useful when additional context or explanations are required.

```
Here is a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is a sample footnote.
```

Here is a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is a sample footnote.
